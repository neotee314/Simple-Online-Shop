     *      - the part before the '@' and the part after the '@' must not be empty, contain of
     *        at least one of these characters (A..Z, a..z, or 0..9) and must not contain any whitespace characters
     *      - the parts before and after the '@' may contain one or several '.' as separators
     *      - two '.' characters must not be directly next to each other (so "test@this..example.com" is invalid)
     *      - the part after the '@' must end with ".de", ".at", ".ch", ".com", ".org"
     *        (for simplicity we do not allow any other domains)
